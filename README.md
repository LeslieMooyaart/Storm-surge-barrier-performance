# Storm-surge-barrier-performance

The matlab-code shared in this repository was used to develop figures of the journal paper "storm surge barrier performance - the effect of barrier failures on extreme water level frequencies". The code can be used to determine storm surge barrier performance at other barriers as well. Indicatory arrows and lines to explain the method will need to be removed manually from the code to attain nicely readible figures.
